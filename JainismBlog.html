 <h1>INTRODUCTION:</h1>      

  Religion, related to any nation or community is the one thing that has never failed to fascinate me. 
  I am a Jain and I have often noticed terrible misconceptions related to Jainism. In this blog, I would
  give you an overview about this amazing culture.
  </p> 
  
  </div>

  <div class="goal">
<h2>THE GOAL:MOKSH </h2>
<p>The begin with, the foremost thing I would want to make you aware about is that Jain Dharma is not as 
difficult as it is often perceived. Jains live their life by following the guidance given by the ‘Tirthankars’
- who are believed to be the 24 spiritual gurus of Jains. Jainism initially came into existence, with Lord Mahavir 
delivering sermons after his enlightenment, until then there had been no information regarding the history of the 
religion. Lord Mahavir had stated a few guidelines which can lead us to Moksha- which is considered to be the utmost
goal. Though, no definite rules are to be followed, one does not fall under any compulsion of following things.
It is completely up to an individual what he/she wants to follow.</p>
</div> 

<div class="parent">
<div class="moksh">
<h3>THE TERM:MOKSH</h3>
<p>
  The few guidelines which are stated by Lord Mahavir revolve around the goal of achieving moksha. Attaining Moksha
  literally means liberation from the endless loop of transformation from one life form into another, in simpler 
  words- from the cycle of birth and death. It is a state of total rest and liberation from the world. It is also 
  commonly known as ‘Nirvana’ to the Buddhists. Now, to understand the entire process of reaching this aim, we would
  have to take a sneak peek at the term ‘Karma’.

<h2>KARMA:</h2>
<p>
  Karma is a relatively common term which each one of us would have encountered. But do we know what it actually
   stands for? In a few religions it is often thought, to be a phenomenon whereby good deeds contribute to a better
   afterlife, but how exactly does this happen? Jainism has the answer. Jainism has a totally different outlook 
   about the term- ‘Karma’. According to Jainism, karma are subtle sticky particles of matter, which are having 
   an extremely strong affinity towards the soul. They are also referred to as – ‘Karmic dirt’. It is believed that
   when a person performs a bad deed, which can be hurtful to others, or even thinks about a deed which can be 
   extremely hurtful then the karmic particles, which are invisible and everywhere around us, stick to the
   person’s soul. This thing occurs throughout one’s life, causing a heap of karmic particles getting attached 
   to one’s soul. This causes the particles to form a chain and twirl around a soul. The soul thus becomes heavier.
   Now, after one’s death, the lightlessness of a soul determines where it travels. A heavy soul would obviously 
   sulk down and move towards the hell, while a relatively light soul, would travel upwards towards the seven 
   heavens. According to the Jain Mythology, our universe has seven heavens and an equal number of hells, with the
   earth being situated at the middle. Anyways coming back, our soul travels according to our deeds, thus we are 
   being responsible for shaping our own re-births, ultimately complying with the other religions.

<div class="science">

<h3>Even Science agrees:</h3>
<p>
  The above stated theory can be supported with a lot of scientific facts. As we know that in accord to newton’s 
  third law, every action has an equal an opposite reaction. This means that if we use energy even about thinking
  something cruel an equal amount of energy in the form of ‘Karmic dirt’ would come to us. This can also be 
  supported by the law of conservation of energy, which states that no energy is created or destroyed, balancing
  the universe.
</p>
</div>
<div class="ways">
  <h2>THE RIGHT PATH:</h2>
  the guidelines given by Lord Mahavir, in order to escape from the loop of life and re-birth. 
  First and foremost way of achieving moksh is: Meditation. Yes, penance is the finest way to achieve moksha. 
  Liberation from the luxurious world can help in shedding of the karma layers from the soul, ultimately making
   it more lighter and positive. Another way is by doing good deeds. Good deeds definitely go a very long way in
    terms of the positive impact on the soul. It lessens the burden carried by the soul. There are also some other
     ways which include fasting, courtesy, pure thoughts etc. Although it’s predicted that achieving moksh in the 
     currently kalyug is next to impossible, you can surely lessen the karma your soul Carries.
